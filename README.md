# Phonebook---Backend Project
https://phonebook-fso2223.fly.dev/

This is a mini project from University of Helsinki's Full-Stack Open Course.
ReactJS, NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB was used for the phonebook app.

This followed the REST API approach for setting up the routes.
Testing via Postman for the backend API. 

Validation was also done in the backend
to make sure input doesn't accept certain values (e.g. specific number of numbers in the phonenumber section, not accepting strings)

Deployment was done via FLY.io.

Note: CSS currently in the works so style is very minimal at the moment.
